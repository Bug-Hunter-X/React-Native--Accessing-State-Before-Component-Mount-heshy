This error occurs when you try to access a property of a component's state before the component has fully mounted.  This is a common issue when using `useState` hook or working with class-based components.

```javascript
// Example: Incorrect usage of state
function MyComponent() {
  const [count, setCount] = useState(0);

  useEffect(() => {
    console.log(count); // May log 'undefined'
  }, []);

  return (
    <View>
      <Text>{count}</Text> 
    </View>
  );
}
```
In this case, the `useEffect` hook runs before the state has had a chance to be initialized, causing `count` to be undefined.
